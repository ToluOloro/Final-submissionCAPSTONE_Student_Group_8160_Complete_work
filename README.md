# Designing and Evaluating Climate Derivatives for Risk Mitigation in Investment Portfolios

**Overview**
This repository contains the research, analysis, and findings of the study titled "Designing and Evaluating Climate Derivatives for Risk Mitigation in Investment Portfolios." The research explores the role of climate derivatives, such as weather options and catastrophe bonds, in hedging against climate-related risks in investment portfolios. It provides a comprehensive framework for designing, pricing, and evaluating these instruments, along with empirical evidence of their effectiveness in reducing portfolio risk and enhancing risk-adjusted returns.

**Key Objectives**

- Climate Risk Mitigation: Develop financial tools to manage physical and transition risks associated with climate change.

- Portfolio Optimization: Integrate climate derivatives into investment portfolios to improve resilience and performance.

- Practical Insights: Address challenges such as high premiums, regulatory gaps, and limited awareness, particularly in emerging markets.

**Repository Structure**

- Abstract: Summary of the research objectives, methodology, and key findings.

- Introduction: Context and motivation for the study, including the limitations of traditional risk management tools.

- Theoretical Framework: Foundations in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), and Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).

**Methodology**

- Data sources (NOAA, IPCC, Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon).

- Analytical techniques (Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo simulations).

- Scenario analysis and portfolio optimization.

**Results**

- Climate volatility, derivative pricing, and expected payoffs.

- Portfolio risk reduction and improved risk-adjusted returns.

- Discussion: Practical implications, challenges, and policy recommendations.

- Conclusion: Summary of findings and future research directions.

- References: Citations of key literature and data sources.

**Key Findings**

- Climate derivatives reduce portfolio risk by 15% and improve risk-adjusted returns by 20% under high-risk scenarios.

- Climate volatility is measured at 4.74, with derivative prices at 29.52 and expected payoffs at 1.49.

- Optimized portfolio weights (0.6, 0.3, 0.15) balance stability and growth potential.

- Challenges include high premiums, regulatory gaps, and limited awareness, particularly in emerging markets.

**Future Scope**

- Long-term climate scenario analysis.

- Region- and sector-specific applications.

- Development of low-cost derivatives for small-scale investors.

- Integration with emerging technologies like blockchain and AI.

- Policy frameworks to promote adoption.
